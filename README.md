# What is Linear Regression?
Linear Regression is one of the simplest and most widely used algorithms in machine learning. It is used for predicting a continuous value based on the relationship between independent (input) variables and a dependent (output) variable.

ðŸ“ˆ Equation of Simple Linear Regression:
y = mx+b
Where:
y is the predicted value (dependent variable)
x is the input feature (independent variable)
m is the slope (coefficient)
b is the y-intercept
